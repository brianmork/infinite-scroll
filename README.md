# Infinite scroll

This project is about fetching photos through Unsplash's API and displaying them in an infinite scroll on a simple web page. Purpose of the project was to train my JavaScript skills as well as connecting with an API and getting actual data loaded onto my site. Used purely HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
